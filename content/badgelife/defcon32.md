This list draws heavily from the work done by [K4rm4ness](https://twitter.com/K4rm4ness) for several years and continues to do.

<summary>What is a SAO?</summary>

Shitty Add-On (SAO) is a printed circuit board (PCB) meant to be attached to badge-sized PCBs. For more verbose details and history of the standard, please see [Hackaday's article](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/20/introducing-the-shitty-add-on-v1-69bis-standard/)!
