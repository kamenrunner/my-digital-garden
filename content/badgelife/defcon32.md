This list draws heavily from the work done by [K4rm4ness](https://twitter.com/K4rm4ness) for several years and continues to do.

<summary>Why have a "Uses Gen 'AI' category?</summary>

DEF CON has had an 'Artist' category badge for a number of years. There are those who may wish to distinguish badges that similarly value artists by having all creativity done by humans.
